# JQL Documentation 📚

Welcome to the official documentation for **JQL (JSON Query Language)**. JQL is a high-performance, streaming-first projection engine designed for the high-intensity requirements of modern data pipelines.

## 🏁 Getting Started

> If you are new to JQL, start here:

- [**Quick Start**](quick-start.md) - Comprehensive guide with examples, streaming, and real-world patterns.
- [**CLI Guide**](cli-guide.md) - Master the command-line interface for shell pipelines and data exploration.
- [**Mental Model**](mental-model.md) - Understand the core concepts and architecture of JQL.
- [**Query Language Guide**](query-language.md) - Learn the JQL syntax, aliasing, and directives.
- [**API Reference**](api-reference.md) - Deep dive into Runtimes, Adapters, and the Core Engine.

## 🚀 Performance & Architecture

Understand why JQL is the fastest JSON engine for the edge:

- [**Internals Deep-Dive**](internals.md) - Learn about GC-Free tokenization, binary line splitting, and object recycling.
- [**Performance Contract**](performance.md) - Our ironclad guarantees for time and memory complexity.
- [**Capabilities**](capabilities.md) - JQL's capabilities and limitations.

## 🛡️ Reliability

- [**Error Handling**](error-handling.md) - JQL's behavior with malformed JSON and corrupted streams.
- [**Non Goals**](non-goals.md) - JQL's non-goals and trade-offs.
